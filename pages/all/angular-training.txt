  I offer a range of AngularJS training to fit your team's experience with Angular. I'm a Google Developer Expert for AngularJS, and I've delivered the training for clients like Thomas Cook and General Assembly, in London and all over the UK.

  Angular training is offered across 2 days: Core and Advanced. They can be taught independently if only part of the course is required, or you have different skill-levels within the team. 

  ## Course structure

  - The philosophy of Angular JS
  - Booting the app
  - Data-binding
  - Controllers
  - Directives
  - Routing
  - Getting data
  - Testing
