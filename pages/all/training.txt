  I have been training developers since 2012 for companies like the European Bioinformatics Institute, Thomas Cook, TMW, Decoded and General Assembly. I specialise in Javascript: [AngularJS](/angular-training), [NodeJS](/nodejs-training), core [Javascript](/javascript-training) and [D3](/d3-training).

  I offer ticketed public training and in-house training for companies.

  My training is structured hands-on practice to ensure attendees can apply what they've learned back at work. Check out some of [my](http://timruffles.github.io/angular-js-class/slides) [materials](http://timruffles.github.io/d3-class/slides/#/) - they're continually improved so you can benefit from updates in the future.

  Please [get in touch](mailto:oi+training@truffles.me.uk) for bookings or questions.
