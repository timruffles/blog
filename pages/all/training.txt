  I have been training developers since 2012 for companies like the European Bioinformatics Institute, Thomas Cook, TMW, Decoded and General Assembly. I specialise in Javascript: [AngularJS](/angular-training), [NodeJS](/nodejs-training), core [Javascript](/javascript-training) and [D3](/d3-training).
