    Thanks for watching!

    - [Laws of reflection](https://blog.golang.org/laws-of-reflection) - once you really understand interfaces, reflection becomes a lot simpler (while still remaining fairly tricky)
    - [Go Data Structures: Interfaces](https://research.swtch.com/interfaces) - a view on interfaces from the implementation POV
    - [Ardan Labs on interfaces](https://www.ardanlabs.com/blog/2017/07/interface-semantics.html) - like the rest of William Kennedy's Go content, this is excellently written
