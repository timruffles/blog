  I write [Javascript](http://github.com/timruffles) for my startup, [SidekickJS](http://www.sidekickjs.com) and Angular and D3 for [Capco](https://ds.capco.com); [train developers](/developer-training) in-house for organisations like Gilt.com, the European Bioinformations Institute, and Inviqa; and [speak](/speaking) at user-groups and conferences. I'm a [Google Developer Expert](https://developers.google.com/experts/people/tim-ruffles) for the web platform, specialising in AngularJS.

  I run the [Functional Javascript](http://lanyrd.com/series/funjsldn/) meetup in London, and maintain the [Javascript Garden](http://bonsaiden.github.com/JavaScript-Garden/). My [technical writing](/writing) appears in a [book](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9781939902085.do) and guest posts for the [Safari Books online](https://blog.safaribooksonline.com/2013/10/02/decoupling-backbone-applications-with-pubsub/) [blog](https://blog.safaribooksonline.com/2013/10/07/backbone-movel-view-persistance/), [.net magazine](https://github.com/timruffles/d3-dot-net), and I've produced a [video course on AngularJS](https://learnable.com/courses/building-an-app-with-angularjs-2841).
