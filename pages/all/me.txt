  I write Ruby and Javascript mainly, along with Python for a side-dish. Occasionally I try to learn Haskell and then a "strong lax monoidal functor" chases me away.

  I enjoy reading, writing, maths, machine learning, [photography](http://www.flickr.com/photos/timruffles/), debating, laundry and eating. Eating especially.
