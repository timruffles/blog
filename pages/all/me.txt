  I write Javascript & Ruby for my startup, [SidekickJS](http://www.sidekickjs.com); teach at [General Assembly](https://generalassemb.ly/instructors/tim-ruffles/904), [Decoded](http://decoded.co) and [Event Handler](www.eventhandler.co.uk); and [speak](http://lanyrd.com/profile/timruffles/past/speaking/) at user-groups and conferences.

  I enjoy doing too many things at once. I'm currently learning to paint and play piano - if you can do either, please give me advice. I used to be into [photography](http://www.flickr.com/photos/timruffles/collections/72157637151558545/).
