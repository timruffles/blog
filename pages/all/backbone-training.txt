  I've been delivering Backbone training since 2012, and have been an active Backbone user since 0.4. My Backbone training is delivered across 2 days, with day one building a core, and day two providing the knowledge you'll need for production ready systems.

  The course covers:

  - MVC and Backbone
  - application structure
  - modelling your domain
  - performance
  - testing Backbone
  - handling persistence
