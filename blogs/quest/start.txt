title: The Goal
body: |
  I'd like to make a product that makes money; not much, just enough to know I can do it.
  
  I've made three products in the past - one that took a long time, one that we thought we were making in the Lean Startup way, one that I made in the Lean Startup style. I'll write about them later.
  
  ## The Product
  
  A simple hiring app, that creates an application form. When candidates apply you and colleagues can vote on, or filter out, candidates. That's it.
  
  I'm focussing heavily on the UX, with inspiration from zero-signup products like Doodle. No passwords to remember, just private urls that can be regenerated.
  
  I've decided to build an MVP for it, without doing customer discovery, because it's something I'd like myself. I know full well that skipping discovery makes it orders of magnitude more likely post 4 or 5 will be "Nobody bought it". If that happens, at least it's an interesting way to try out Knockout.js, and I could use it for a screencast.
  
  ## The Goal
  
  I'd like to launch it by July 14th. That feels like a long way off, but I know how hard fitting things around work is.
