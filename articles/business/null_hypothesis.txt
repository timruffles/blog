title: "What's your startup's null hypothesis?"

  I've realised that without an experimental control, any 'test' I do of my startup ideas is invalid. It's incredibly easy to get people to say something is a good idea - first because of politeness, second because it's very cheap to do so, third because no idea you come up with is going to be obviously worse than existing products.
  
  People are naturally very polite. Causing offense is risky, it's a cost. Saying nice things is extremely cheap, good for getting people to like you, and pretty much risk free. When someone asks you for feedback, it's very much the easy option.
  
  Explaning why you don't like something is both an immediate and long term cost. You have to think hard about your reasons and work out how to say them in a way that doesn't cause offence. In the long term, you've damaged your reputation with that person and created the opportunity of being proven wrong. If you say bad things about an idea and it works, the proponent will want to make you pay. If you had said nice things and it fails, their ego is at stake equally - they're not going to hunt you down and point out your error.
  
  Finally - no idea you're likely to come up with would be, on the surface, bad. "A better mousetrap" is a classic non-business. Anyone could fix an aspect of a mousetrap, explain this fix to someone and have that person say, "Yes, it is a better mousetrap". However, it is not better to the extent where it overcomes the various switching costs, the costs of acquisition, perhaps even the additional cost from its manufacturing. "Good ideas" are very simple to create. Businesses are not.
  
  So with the above it's clear that "That's a good idea" is a null signal. It convays 0 information about whether your startup idea is a business - the null case, non-business, will elicit the same signal. 
  
  Non-null signals are those are close as possible to the actual business situation - likely paying money. Any cost is good though - if you've imposed a cost on people which they willingly undergo to access your startup's value proposition, that's real value. An email signup form is a reasonable signal, a fake payment page is better (in a sense, you've already taken (perception of risk of click costing me Â£$) from people). Just like a scientist, if you're testing a business idea you need to know what a real signal looks like.
