title: DoString - a project to learn Erlang

  I really got excited about Erlang for the first time at BuildStuff.lt. There were several incredible talks that covered Erlang - Joe Armstrong, John Hughes etc. What impressed me most was the focus on fault tolerence. There was a clear-eyed acceptance of our software being as secure as a giraffe trying to sprint on two legs: destined to fail, soon.

  Coupled with that it seemed like Erlang had been parallel before it was cool. And functional. And, in a sense, more object oriented than any 'OO' language as communication was asynchronous and the agents entirely distinct.

  Anyway - the reasons Erlang are interesting are numerous enough to deserve another post. What did I build?
