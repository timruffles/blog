    I did this search back in 2013 - but never got round to blogging it, only <a href='https://gist.github.com/timruffles/5f762a14b16fe1465aa0'>sent an email</a> with that I'd found... Now I look unoriginal as someone has done the <a href='http://quoteinvestigator.com/2014/02/28/clever-lazy/#note-8291-9'>same research</a> and found the same things. Publish early! :)

  It's one of those quotes that sticks in your head:

  > ‘I divide my officers into four: clever, diligent, stupid, and lazy. Usually two characteristics are combined. The clever and diligent belong in the General Staff. The stupid and diligent must not be entrusted with any responsibility because he will always cause only mischief’

  I saw it a few times, always attributed to a different person. It irked me, so I dug around on Google and Google books. Horrible [self-help books][] were attributing it to Manstein. Recent books attributed it to a military theorist of the 19th century - [Clauswitz][]. In 1965 it was being attributed to the French General Foch in a [legal journal][] by 1965. Eventually I ran out of hits, leaving the earliest attribution as [Kurt Von Hammerstein][] in the [Proceedings of the United Naval Institute, March 1933, Volume 59, No. 3][1].

  What's interesting is the slow increase in misattributions. It suggests lots of people vaguely remembering a German general, picking one at random, or even moving onto French generals or  Even by 1942 it was attributed to "A German General" in the [House of Lords][hol]. Amusingly the most extreme misattribution chronologically speaking was in a [Cambridge University press book][2] - to the 18th century Prussian King [Frederick the Great][3]!
