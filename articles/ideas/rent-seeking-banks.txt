title: Charging £30 for an if statement

  Banks are still absurdly uncompetitive. Currently British banks charge between £8 and £30 for returned payment. They justify the expense because of the 'administrative cost' of a 'returned payment'. This is total bullshit. The concept of their being any work 

  Here is the currently functionality in pseudo code:

  <pre>
  if(standingOrder.amount > account.balance) {
    issueCharge(account,30);
    sendPenaltyLetter()
  } else {
    standingOrder.run(account);
  }
  </pre>

  Here's a better user experience, implemented free of charge for the first bank that cares about its users:

  <pre>
  if(standingOrder.amount > account.balance) {
    notifyStandingOrderFailed(account); 
  } else {
    standingOrder.run(account);
  }
  </pre>
