  You can now [try out](https://timruffles.github.io/js-to-c/) my JS to C compiler in the browser! Edit the JS code on the left, and see the resulting C code on the right.

  I started the project last year with a [solo retreat to the alps](/writing-a-javascript-to-c-compiler), working through [SICP](http://wiki.c2.com/?StructureAndInterpretationOfComputerPrograms) with pen and paper. Now I've learned everything I want to from the project, I'm free to start something new!

  I would love to hear what you find interesting about it after having a play. Do delve into the [source code](https://github.com/timruffles/js-to-c/blob/master/src/js-to-c.ts) too.
