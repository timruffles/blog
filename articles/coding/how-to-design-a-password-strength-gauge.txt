title: How to design a non-broken password strength meter

  Most password strengths validators I find online are broken and actively reduce security. They're based on a misunderstanding of what makes a strong password.

  As an example, imagine a password made of only 'a's and 'b's. Doesn't sound very strong does it? But if it's 60 characters long, chosen at random, you've got a password it'd take a few centuries to brute force.
