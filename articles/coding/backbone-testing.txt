title: "Series intro: Building better Backbone apps faster with tests"  
date: 22/04/2012
body: |

  Testing your Backbone apps will let you write better apps, faster. This series will take you from the basics all the way to advanced testing.
  
  Why should you care about testing? Let me give you a before and after story.
  
  #### Before

  <div class="story bad">
    <div class="smiley">☹</div>
    <p>It's Friday at 18.46. Your app isn't working on IE <em>again</em>. You fix and deploy, and realise you've deployed a one character typo. Meeting friends in the pub? Don't think so.</p>
  </div>
  
  #### After
  
  Flash to a cheesy [silver-bullet](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?SilverBullet) comparison:
  
  <div class="story good">
    <div class="smiley">☺</div>
    <p>IE didn't have <code>Array#indexOf</code> and <code>String#substr</code> can't handle negative indicies but your tests alterted you as you went. The release went great: no suprise, you already knew it worked from your happily blinking test suites. Desk beer!</p>
  </div>

  I can't promise you this series is a ticket to silver-bullet land. But I can promise you that adopting the pragmatic approach to testing it promotes will result in less stress, faster development, and better apps.
  
  ## Series overview
  
  The articles in the series will be:
  
  1. Introduction to testing with Backbone - for test beginners
  1. Nuts'n'bolts of Javascript testing - stubs, mocks and assertions
  1. Testing Backbone views
  1. Testing Backbone models
  1. Creating a mocked server for Backbone apps
  1. The fiddly bit - asyncronous tests
  1. Functional tests for Backbone
  1. Advanced Backbone views - easy testing with view models
  1. The hard problem of testing - when to test, what to test
  
  I'll also be creating a [Javascript & Backbone testing glossary](/javascript-backbone-testing-glossary) as I go.
  
  ## Disclaimer and my Backbone experience
  
  I stress this is series is drawn from the methods I've found most effective while developing a number of products with Backbone - [real time games](http://picklive.com), a [Twitter client](http://teachthebird.com) and [Chrome extensions](http://arachnys.com). There are many opinions about testings. If there's controversy about the best way of writing tests I'll flag it up with my choice and the reasoning behind it.
  
  ## Series lessons
  
  By the end of it you'll be able to:
    
  - write well tested Backbone models and views
  - test all the fiddly bits - functional tests, AJAX and asynchronous tests
  - create demo servers to run your app without a live backend.
  
  The core messages I'll be attempting to promote and justify are:
    
  - JS/Backbone testing is easy and valuable
  - knowing when to test is a hard problem
  - testing is a tool, not a goal
  
  ## Schedule
  
  I'll be posting the rest of the articles over the next few weeks. Subscribe to [the feed](http://feeds.feedburner.com/TimRufflesBlog) to be notified of the new articles.
  
  If you're in the UK, you like the class I'm running at General Assembly London, [Building Web Apps with Backbone.js](http://www.eventbrite.com/event/3306153795/eorg?ebtv=C). It'll take you through Backbone.js from the basics, and work through a case study of converting a leagacy procedural Javascript/forms based app into a single-page Backone app.
