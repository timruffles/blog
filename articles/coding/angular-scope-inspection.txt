  It's pretty important to keep an eye on the number of watchers in your Angular app. Here's a quick function to do just that:

      function countWatchers(scope, n) {
        n = n || 0;
        n += scope.$$watchers.length;
        var child = scope.$$childHead
        while(child) {
          n += countWatchers(child);
          child = child.$$nextSibling;
        }
        return n;
      }

  Use as follows:

      // $0 = last element inspected in Chrome
      var scope = angular.element($0).scope();
      countWatchers(scope);
      // 138
