  What does the below company (Thames Water) seem to be spending the most on?

  Click to see the [actual numbers](img/thames-water-infographic.jpg).

  Looking at the area of the shapes in the visualisation suggests the following order:

  1. Day to day running
  1. Building for the future
  1. Financing cost

  With probably 10-15% more on 'Day to day running' than 'Building for the future'.

  Look at the numbers and it's actually:

  1. Building for the future 46%
  1. Day to day running 30%
  1. Financing cost 22%

  So while it was visually 10-20% bigger, 'Day to Day Running' represented 50% less of the real total than 'Building for the Future'! An accurate visual representation would be the below:

  The problem is that the pie chart system, where a category that takes 50% of the whole gets 180<sup>o</sup> degrees and therefore 50% of the area, has been misapplied to non-circular shape. The distortion affects the categories that sit in the non-circular area:

  Designers: infographics aren't just there to look pretty. They're sending a message - quite possible the wrong one. Double-check that the visual impression you're creating fits the data!
