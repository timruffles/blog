  What does the below company (Thames Water) seem to be spending the most on?

  Click to see the [actual numbers](img/thames-water-infographic.jpg).

  Looking at the area of the shapes in the visualisation suggests the following order:

  1. Day to day running
  1. Building for the future
  1. Financing cost

  With probably 10-15% more on 'Day to day running' than 'Building for the future'.

  Look at the numbers and it's actually:

  1. Building for the future 46%
  1. Day to day running 30%
  1. Financing cost 22%

  So while it was visually 10-20% bigger, 'Day to Day Running' represented 50% less of the real total than 'Building for the Future'! An accurate visual representation would be the below:

  <a class="jsbin-embed" href="http://jsbin.com/simof/6/embed?output">JS Bin</a><script src="http://static.jsbin.com/js/embed.js"></script>

  The problem is that the pie chart system, where a category that takes 50% of the whole gets 180<sup>o</sup> degrees and therefore 50% of the area, has been misapplied to non-circular shape. The distortion affects the categories that sit in the non-circular area:

  So about 30% of the infographic wasn't information, but noise.

  Designers: infographics aren't just there to look pretty: they are there to communicate. Double-check that the message you're sending fits the data!
